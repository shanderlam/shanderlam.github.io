<p>
Be default,  zip will replace identically named entries in the existing zip archive (matching the relative names as stored in the archive) or add entries for new names. If you want to keep the zip archive sync, you can use the File Sync option(-FS). The new File Sync option is also considered a new mode, though it is similar to update.  This mode synchronizes the archive with the files on the OS, only replacing files in the archive if the file time or size of the OS  file  is different, adding new files, and deleting entries from the archive where there is no matching file.  As this mode can delete entries from the archive, consider making a backup copy of the archive.
