If you want to include your location information for publish photos in iPhoto. Go to Preferences of iPhoto, select Web tab, then check the Include Location Information for Published Photos box. Then when you share your photos via clicking Flickr icon, the location information will also be uploaded and the photos will be added to your map in Filckr.
