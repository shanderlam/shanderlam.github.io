In C Mode, you can use *c-show-syntactic-information* ( bound to <kbd>C-c
C-s</kbd> keystores ) function for getting syntactic information of current
line. If you don't know what name the syntactic symbol of current line is, you
can get it via this function. So it is useful if you want to custom indentation
of c mode.
